# zig-gl-learning
So far, these examples just extend https://github.com/hexops/mach-glfw-opengl-example by following the "Getting started" chapters at https://learnopengl.com/.
In order to run these examples as is, you need to clone the repos zigimg and mach-glfw into "ref" so that symbolic links resolve correctly.
