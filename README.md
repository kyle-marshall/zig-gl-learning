# zig-gl-learning

So far, these examples just extend https://github.com/hexops/mach-glfw-opengl-example by following the "Getting started" chapters at https://learnopengl.com/.

In order to run the examples as they are, you will need to clone the repos [zigimg](https://github.com/zigimg/zigimg) and [mach-glfw](https://github.com/hexops/mach-glfw) into "ref" so that symbolic links resolve correctly.
